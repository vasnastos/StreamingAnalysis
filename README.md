`python analysis.py`


## Pipelines

- Traffic Volume Analysis:
    Time Series Analysis: Examine traffic volume over time to identify patterns, trends, peaks, and troughs.
    Volume by IP/Port: Analyze the data volume by source and destination IP, as well as by ports, to identify which hosts and services are the most active.
- Performance Analysis:
    Latency Analysis: If you have timestamp information, you can analyze the latency between packets.
    Packet Size Analysis: Understand the distribution of packet sizes to optimize network performance.


## Datasets
**External datasets**
- **UWF-ZeekData22**: This is a comprehensive network traffic dataset based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework1. The dataset was collected using Zeek and labelled using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It can be used to develop user profiles of groups intending to perform attacks. The dataset is publicly available at datasets.uwf.edu1.
- ** Traffic analysis for 5G network slice:** This research paper discusses a home traffic analysis system combined with the Internet of Things2. Although itâ€™s not a dataset, it might provide useful insights for your work.
- **Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection:** This collection includes several large network datasets, including social networks, networks with ground-truth communities, and communication networks3. While the format may not be exactly the same as your dataset, you might still find them useful for your analysis.
